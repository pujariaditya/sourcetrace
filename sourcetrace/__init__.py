"""sourcetrace: open-set audio deepfake source tracing (STOPA + MLAAD).

Attribute a synthetic utterance to its generator (acoustic-model x vocoder) and
reject unseen generators, using a frozen self-supervised speech frontend and a
light trainable head + open-set score.

Public API. Two distinct laziness steps, which are easy to conflate:

1. Importing this package loads no torch-backed module at all. Touching one of the
   names below imports it (and therefore torch, transformers, s3prl).
2. Importing those modules still builds no model. WavLM and EnCodec are constructed on
   the first extraction call -- ``WavLMFrontend._ensure_model`` / the EnCodec equivalent
   -- so ``Extractor(...)`` is cheap and the first ``extract`` is not.

* :class:`Extractor` / :func:`extract_features` -- frozen-SSL feature extractor
  (audio -> 2133-d), :mod:`sourcetrace.features`.
* :class:`Method` -- the trainable head + open-set score, with checkpoint
  ``save`` / ``load``, :mod:`sourcetrace.method`.
* :func:`compute_eer` / :func:`compute_fpr95` / :func:`compute_stopa_eer`
  -- the exact protocol metrics (lightweight, eager), :mod:`sourcetrace.metrics.protocol`.

* :func:`require_torch` / :func:`require_frontend` / :func:`require_packages` -- exit
  with an actionable message instead of a traceback when the interpreter has no usable
  PyTorch, or when a needed package is missing, :mod:`sourcetrace.runtime`. Every
  entry point that imports a heavy dependency calls the one that matches what it
  needs -- in ``scripts/``, in ``analysis/``, and the ``python -m`` modules below.

Entry points, all driven through ``python -m``:

``sourcetrace.extract``
    Audio -> the 2133-d feature cache, one ``<group>.npy`` per split/system.
``sourcetrace.train``
    Fit the head for one task and write a checkpoint.
``sourcetrace.evaluate``
    Score a checkpoint against a protocol, or fit and score in one shot.

The shell wrappers in ``scripts/`` are the documented way in --
``scripts/smoke.py`` to check an install, ``scripts/verify_results.sh`` for the
reported table, ``scripts/run_ablations.sh`` for the ablation sweep.

The evaluation protocols themselves live in :mod:`sourcetrace.tasks` (``fit_*`` /
``eval_*`` / ``evaluate_*`` for MLAAD v5 and STOPA); the split builders in
:mod:`sourcetrace.datasets`; the frozen hyperparameters and the ``configs/*.yaml``
overlay in :mod:`sourcetrace.config`.
