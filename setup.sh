# the MLAAD manifests, the merge map, the STOPA attack grid all ship in assets/.
# What this fetches is the two frozen front-end models the feature extractor runs
# audio through, and neither is redistributed here.

# It installs no Python packages. Do that first, with `pip install -e .`, under
# the sourcetrace environment -- every entry point checks the interpreter and
# will tell you if it is the wrong one.
# --help: the header comment above IS the documentation, so print it rather than
# maintaining a second copy that can drift out of date. Anything other than -h/--help
# is rejected: this script takes no positional arguments, and silently ignoring one
# would look like it had been honoured -- here that means `./setup.sh --help`
# starting a multi-gigabyte download instead of printing anything.
